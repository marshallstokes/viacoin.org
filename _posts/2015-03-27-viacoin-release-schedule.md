title: Viacoin Release Schedule
---

Viacoin Core is the reference client for the viacoin network. The project aims to have regular maintenance and feature releases. This post will explain the target schedule.

We aim to release major version releases roughly every 6-8 months and maintenance versions periodically as required. Maintenance releases fix minor bugs and issues where the upgrading would not generally be considered essential. Major version releases would be considered highly recommended, especially for miners and include new features.

There are different components of Viacoin Core. The full node component for example affects the network consensus. Upgrades here are considered essential. The wallet code is more user facing and less important to upgrade although users who would prefer the most up to date user experience would be encouraged to upgrade frequently.

At the time of writing the current major release is `0.10` and the next major version would be `0.11`. The numbers after that are for maintenance releases. For example, the current maintenence version is `0.10.6`  so the next will be `0.10.7` due in the next few weeks and the next major version would be expected by late summer.

Please note these are guidelines and sometimes releases will take longer or short than expected.
