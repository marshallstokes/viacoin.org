title: The Blockchain Notary
---

Today we officially announce a new service protocol called the "Blockchain Notary" which we have implemented in ClearingHouse.

The Blockchain Notary is a two fold protocol that allows for cryptographic timestamping of digital assets and documents; and the ability to own and transfer them.

Notaries are owned by a key and can be transferred, just like bitcoins or viacoins to a new owner's key, thus transferring the digital rights. Even without considering digitial rights transfers, it means notaries can be categorized and stored neatly under specific keys.

Noraries also have a convenience description field making them easy to identify.

A front end interface has been developed for in [Clearwallet](https://clearwallet.co) for the purpose and you can also verify if digital assets have already been notarized.
