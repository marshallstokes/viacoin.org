title: AntiGravity Upgrade 0.10.5
---

We have released *Viacoin Core 0.10.5* which brings updates block retargetting.  As of block 451,000 the network will switch to an improved difficulty retargetting formula called *AntiGravityWave*. The purpose is to bring smoother blocks distribution, stronger resistance to timewarp attacks, and fix a bug that yields 5% less blocks found daily than intended. Please update as soon as possible, **this upgrade is mandatory**.

Please download from [here](https://github.com/viacoin/viacoin/releases/tag/v0.10.5)

*If you compile from the git repo source, please make sure you use the `v0.10.5` version tag as the `master` branch is not for production use. The source code tarball can also be obtained from the link above.*

**This upgrade is mandatory**.
