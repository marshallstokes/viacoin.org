Viacoin / ClearingHouse Project Update for the week of Friday 5th September 2014

We will be releasing more regular project updates as promised. While our update schedule is still tentative, we believe in open communication with the community and keeping our supporters up to date as much as possible. This progress report is meant as a general overview of our updates, but will not be technical in nature. When new features are fully released we will go into more detail.

**Charity:** Viacoin has partnered with the Mintcoinfund Keepod Kid project, Keepod.org (recently featured on BBC News) which offers technology that allows people to have their own personal computer settings stored in a small device which they can take and use anywhere in the world there is a computer with internet access. More details can be found at [http://mintcoinfund.org/projects/sponsor-keepod-kid/](http://mintcoinfund.org/projects/sponsor-keepod-kid/)

**Adoption:** We have met with an established ATM vendor to collaborate with their engineers to add Viacoin to their platform. This will also bring Viacoin onto Android phones with a native app in the long term. We’ll announce further details once the company is ready to make an announcement. The ATM release is most likely a couple of weeks away while we hope to see integration into their other services coming next week.

**Media:** We were recently interviewed by three journalists this week from Coindesk, Altcoin Today and a legal journal investigating smart contracts and we are expecting these articles to be published in the near future.

**ClearingHouse:** The Blockchain Notary feature is nearing completion. We’re working on some final testing and when it’s live we will release an update and documentation. This will be a breakthrough feature that not only does timestamping notary of documents, but also ownership and transfer, all on the Viacoin blockchain.

**CustodyChains:** The specification has been 85% fleshed out and is under internal peer review from our team. The concept has already been notarized in the blockchain. CustodyChains have valuable use cases for law enforcement, civil/corporate law, and a variety of traditional industries.

**Website:** Clearinghouse.io will be redesigned and we thank @drei4u for his contribution to this project.

**Meetings**: We will be meeting with Peter Todd in person, in London next week to discuss development.

**“Business Development”:** we have a team of well connected Venture Capitalists and Angel Investors who are also Viacoin enthusiasts helping promote Viacoin in the real world. They have been having meetings with relevant names in the industry and leveraging their network of contacts to get real world adoption and awareness of Viacoin / ClearingHouse.

**Community:** We’ve continued to see support from the community of various social media, forums and increased exchange volume. We’re excited to have a broader base of support, and want to remind everyone that the project is open source and ongoing, so feel free to jump in with development.

**Viacoin Core:** Dozens of commits have been merged from Bitcoin Core, to keep the codebase fully up to date. The ‘addrindex’ patch was implemented to allow direct UTXO queries from the viacoin daemon.

**Clearwallet:** We’re working on various patches, collaboration, testing and resolving issues in Clearwallet. Work is ongoing, and we will release the specifics when we’ve reached our next milestone and have made the changes live.

**ClearingHouse Daemon:** Tagged new version v9.42.0

We hope this update has given you a taste of what’s going on behind the scenes and there has been a lot of progress already considering the project is still only a few weeks old.
