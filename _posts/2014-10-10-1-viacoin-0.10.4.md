---

Viacoin Core 0.10.4 has been released for general availablilty.

This is a maintenance release which increases the size of relayable transactions as well as increasing the allowable OP_RETURN relay to 120 bytes. The latter change is required for an up and coming ClearingHouse protocol feature called `CustodyChains`.

The release also includes a new feature allowing the `viacoind` to query address balances for keys it does not own. This is utilized primarily by [Clearwallet](https://clearwallet.co) and may prove useful to other projects.

Please [download](https://github.com/viacoin/viacoin/releases/tag/v0.10.4) the latest binaries from [Github](https://github.com/viacoin/viacoin/releases/tag/v0.10.4). If you compile from source using a repository clone, please make **very** sure you use the `v0.10.4` tag with `git fetch --tags; git checkout v0.10.4` as the `master` branch is not be considered stable.
